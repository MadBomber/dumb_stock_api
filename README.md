# dumb_stock_api

Intent: Create a Ruby API wrapper around the simple API used by `dumbstockapi.com`

I will use Faraday to do the http access because I like Faraday.  I would rather have a GreatDay but a Faraday is better than a bad day.

Doing this specificlly to support my `sqa` gem which uses direct access to the website in order to validate stock ticker symbols.
